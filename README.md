#  Hospitality Management System (HMS)

The **Hospitality Management System (HMS)** is a command-line-based hotel management project developed using **Python** and **MySQL**. It is designed to automate and manage hotel operations such as room bookings, guest check-ins, assigning services (like meals, laundry, spa), and final bill generation.

This system can help hotel staff reduce manual paperwork and keep track of all operations efficiently using a structured relational database.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate the basic operations of a hotel management system. It provides functionalities like:
- Guest registration and room assignment
- Reservation tracking
- Adding and managing services
- Generating bills for each guest
- Maintaining historical records of guests and services used

This CLI-based tool is ideal for small hotels or for students learning about integrating Python with SQL.
